## What is a Digital Identity?

A Digital Identity is your brands online presence across any and all online properties that it exists upon and within.

## What is the purpose of a Digital Identity?

Developing and managing your Digital Identity is very much a public relations function. You do not want your brand to have a consumer facing online presence that is disparate across various channels and/or out of your simply businessâ€™s control or influence. Creating a cohesive Digital Identity requires strategic planning and forethought.
