## What is Web Development?
Web Development is the process and technology of creating websites and web applications.

## What is the purpose of Web Development?
Having a presentable website or web application is a must for any business, whether they transact any business online, or they are solely an *in-person* operation. Your website is your business's representation to the general public, and more importantly, it is the main point of reference for your current and potential clientele.
