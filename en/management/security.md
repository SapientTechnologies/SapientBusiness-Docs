## What is Security?

Security is building and implementing processes and systems that remain dependable in the face of challenge, malice, error, or mistake.

## What is the purpose of Security?

Businesses rely on security plans to protect themselves, their employees, and their customers. This leads to greater consumer confidence, trust, and retention. Well crafted security will ensure operations are kept running with minimal downtime; no matter the nature of an incident. Businesses use these practices to gain knowledge of where their vulnerabilities are and where improvements need to be made.

From a legal department view, businesses are afford a manner of legal protection (ie. acceptable use policies, non-compete contracts, etc.). Certain industries, such as healthcare and government contractors, are even required to maintain specific levels of security compliance.
